#### Simple 3D Javascript Particles Engine ####

Sparks.js is a library to help create 3D particles in Javascript.

I hope that it is a simple, fast and fun particles engine to play with.

This is an ongoing project, so check out issue tracker, the [wiki](https://github.com/zz85/sparks.js/wiki), the code, and the examples inside github.

Sparks.js welcome feature and pull requests, so don't be shy to fork away!

It uses [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) for Vector classes and rendering and ease functions from [tween.js](https://github.com/sole/tween.js/).
